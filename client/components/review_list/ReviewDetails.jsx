      <h2>The go-to block.</h2>
      <p>The yoga block is sturdy, yet light.
        asy to grasp. Does not slip on the floor. Aesthetically pleasing. I use it to help with stretches. The block is solid and stable on any of the three axis/orientations which you could say make it work as if it was three.</p>
