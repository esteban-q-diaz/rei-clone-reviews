# REI Clone (Customer Reviews Microservice)

Collaborated with a team of 3 to create a Full Stack REI Clone Application with full functionality.  To establish a successful workflow we created a clear code of conduct, practiced Agile workflow to meet delivarables.  The results were an REI Clone application that closely resembles the actual REI Page.

* Sort by star review

* Add to helpful count (yes/no)
* Load more pagination - loads 12 reviews at a time
